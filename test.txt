THis is going to be my first todo app that i will be building indepently with 
minimal external resources for guild.
will work on the ui then proceed to the functionality of the app
I had to redo the ui of my todo app. everything is fine nd wowrking well.
Next is the funtionality of the app. THis will require some js code
first i need to target the dom nodes where i will out my code.
secondly i will have to write a function that will handle the input and display it.
I added more functionality to my todo app to make it more functional and active.
I have to add some little more  function to make it more flexible for it user.
